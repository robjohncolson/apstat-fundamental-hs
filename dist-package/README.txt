🎯 FOR STUDENTS
===============
This system teaches you AP Statistics by having you work with classmates 
to discover the right answers through peer consensus. No cheating possible
because there are no answer keys - knowledge emerges naturally!

• Answer statistical questions honestly
• Rate your confidence level (1-5 scale)  
• Help score classmates' free response answers
• Watch your reputation grow as you improve
• Learn about real blockchain and consensus technology

👨‍🏫 FOR TEACHERS  
=================
This implements proven constructivist learning principles through modern
technology. Students build statistical knowledge collaboratively while
learning about blockchain, consensus, and peer review.

• Works offline - perfect for unreliable school internet
• No setup required - just open in browser
• Students' progress saves automatically to their browser
• Built-in assessment tools and progress tracking
• Aligns with AP Statistical Practices 1-4

See docs/teacher-guide.html for complete implementation instructions.

⚙️ TECHNICAL DETAILS
=====================
• Built on formal 58-atom mathematical model
• Verified by 13 mathematical invariants
• Compiled from Haskell to WebAssembly
• Complete offline functionality via Service Worker
• Uses browser's built-in cryptography (SHA-256)
• Responsive design works on phones, tablets, laptops
• No external dependencies or tracking

🔒 PRIVACY & SECURITY
=====================
✅ All data stays on the student's device
✅ No personal information collected or transmitted
✅ No internet connection required
✅ Students can export/delete their data anytime
✅ Cryptographic signatures prevent tampering
✅ Anti-gaming measures prevent cheating

🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING
==================
Problem: Page won't load
Solution: Update your browser to the latest version

Problem: Buttons don't respond  
Solution: Make sure JavaScript is enabled in browser settings

Problem: Charts not showing
Solution: Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

Problem: Can't see all content on small screen
Solution: Zoom out (Ctrl+- or Cmd+-) or use landscape mode

Problem: Lost progress
Solution: Make sure browser allows local data storage

Problem: System running slowly
Solution: Close other browser tabs, restart browser if needed

📞 GETTING HELP
===============
• Built-in tutorial: Click "🎓 Tutorial" in the main interface
• Student guide: Open docs/student-guide.html  
• Teacher guide: Open docs/teacher-guide.html
• Technical info: Open docs/technical-reference.html
• System test: Click "🧪 Run Full System Test"

🎓 LEARNING OBJECTIVES
======================
Students who use this system will:

✅ Master core AP Statistics concepts through active problem-solving
✅ Develop statistical reasoning by explaining their thinking
✅ Learn to assess their own confidence and knowledge
✅ Experience how knowledge emerges through peer collaboration
✅ Understand consensus mechanisms used in modern technology
✅ Practice academic integrity and honest self-assessment

💡 EDUCATIONAL THEORY  
=====================
This system implements:
• Constructivist learning (students build knowledge actively)
• Social constructivism (learning through peer interaction)
• Authentic assessment (no gaming possible with emergent consensus)
• Metacognitive development (confidence rating and self-reflection)
• Technology integration (blockchain as educational tool)

🌟 WHY BLOCKCHAIN FOR EDUCATION?
===============================
Traditional education relies on authority (teacher has answer key).
This system models real-world knowledge creation where truth emerges
through peer review and consensus - just like scientific communities,
democratic institutions, and modern decentralized technologies.

Students experience:
• How statistical inference actually works in practice
• The power and limitations of peer consensus  
• The importance of honesty and calibrated confidence
• Real-world applications of mathematical concepts

🎊 SUCCESS CRITERIA
===================
System is working correctly when:
✅ All 58 atoms verified (green dots in verification panel)
✅ All 13 invariants pass (run system test)
✅ Students can submit attestations and see consensus form
✅ Tutorial completes without errors
✅ Reputation scores update based on performance
✅ Works completely offline (disconnect internet to test)

📈 TYPICAL CLASS SESSION
========================
1. Students open system (2 minutes)
2. Select and answer 2-3 questions (15 minutes)  
3. Peer scoring of free response questions (10 minutes)
4. Class discussion of consensus patterns (15 minutes)
5. Reflection and connection to statistical concepts (8 minutes)

Total: 50 minutes (perfect for class period)

🏆 ADVANCED USAGE
=================
Once comfortable with basics:
• Investigate the 13 invariants (click ? buttons)
• Try to achieve high reputation with high confidence
• Analyze convergence patterns across different question types
• Export your data and analyze your own learning patterns
• Create new questions following the JSON format
